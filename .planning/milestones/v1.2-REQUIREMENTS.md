# Requirements: v1.2 Theme Finalization

**Defined:** 2026-01-21
**Core Value:** Guilds give players a reason to come back daily and feel part of something bigger than their solo grind.

## v1.2 Requirements

Apply the approved Modern theme layout and styling from MockGameScreen to the actual game, creating a polished, cohesive visual experience.

### Layout

- [ ] **LAYOUT-01**: Game uses two-sidebar layout (left: party/inventory, right: zone info/actions)
- [ ] **LAYOUT-02**: Center content has balanced proportions (zone content constrained, social expanded)
- [ ] **LAYOUT-03**: Zone content area uses fixed height (not flex-1), keeping social visible
- [ ] **LAYOUT-04**: Layout works responsively on mobile (375px), tablet (768px), desktop (1280px+)

### Theme Application

- [ ] **THEME-01**: Modern theme color palette applied to all game components
- [ ] **THEME-02**: Beveled button styling from MockGameScreen applied to action buttons
- [ ] **THEME-03**: Card styling matches Modern theme (borders, shadows, backgrounds)
- [ ] **THEME-04**: Typography follows Modern theme scale and weights
- [ ] **THEME-05**: Interactive elements have consistent hover/active states

### Component Updates

- [ ] **COMP-01**: GameContainer updated to two-sidebar layout
- [ ] **COMP-02**: PartySidebar matches MockPartySidebar styling
- [ ] **COMP-03**: ZoneView matches MockWorldView styling and proportions
- [ ] **COMP-04**: ChatPanel matches MockSocialSidebar styling
- [ ] **COMP-05**: ActionButtons use BeveledButton component

### Polish

- [ ] **POLISH-01**: Remove MockGameScreen and theme-compare after migration complete
- [ ] **POLISH-02**: Update Storybook stories to reflect new theme
- [ ] **POLISH-03**: Verify all existing functionality works with new layout
