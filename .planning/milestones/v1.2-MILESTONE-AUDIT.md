## Tech Debt

### Non-Critical Items (2)

**Phase 19: Cleanup & Polish**
1. MDX documentation pages excluded from Storybook build due to Vite/@storybook/blocks resolution issue
   - **Impact:** Minor - lost supplemental docs (Typography, Colors, Spacing pages), all component stories work
   - **Remediation:** Consider fixing Storybook MDX resolution in future if docs pages needed

2. E2E tests use CSS class selectors instead of data-testid attributes
   - **Impact:** Minor - tests may be brittle if class names change
   - **Remediation:** Add data-testid attributes incrementally if tests become flaky

## Visual Regressions Fixed

During Phase 19 E2E verification, several visual issues were discovered and fixed:

1. **BeveledButton transform overflow** - Fixed with padding-bottom/margin-top on .btn-3d
2. **Duplicate zone names** - Consolidated to single top-left overlay
3. **Shadow elements** - Removed from SpriteTrainer and PokemonCompanion
4. **"In Town" center text** - Removed redundant status overlay
5. **Layout sizing issues** - Adjusted zone container minHeight to 400px
6. **Map sidebar overflow** - Changed from overflow:hidden to overflow-y:auto

All regressions were fixed before audit.

## Conclusion

**Milestone v1.2 Theme Finalization has achieved its definition of done.**

The Modern theme from MockGameScreen has been successfully applied to the production game:
- ✓ Two-sidebar layout with balanced proportions
- ✓ Modern theme colors active via CSS variables
- ✓ Beveled button styling on action buttons
- ✓ Zone-specific backgrounds with ambient particles
- ✓ Time-of-day sky system
- ✓ Chat bubbles with role-based colors
- ✓ Mobile tab bar with proper labels and active states
- ✓ MockGameScreen removed, Storybook integrated, E2E tests set up

**Ready for milestone completion.**
