# Roadmap: v1.2 Theme Finalization

**Created:** 2026-01-21
**Target:** Apply Modern theme from MockGameScreen to actual game

## Overview

v1.2 focuses on applying the approved two-sidebar layout and Modern theme styling from MockGameScreen to the production game. This is a visual polish milestone with no new gameplay features.

## Phases

### Phase 16: Layout Migration ✓

**Goal:** Restructure GameContainer to use two-sidebar layout with balanced proportions

**Status:** COMPLETE (2026-01-21)

**Scope:**
- Update GameContainer to match MockGameScreen layout structure
- Left sidebar: Party + Inventory
- Right sidebar: Zone info + Actions
- Center: Zone content (constrained) + Social (expanded)
- Verify responsive behavior at all breakpoints

**Requirements:** LAYOUT-01, LAYOUT-02, LAYOUT-03, LAYOUT-04

**Plans:** 2 plans

Plans:
- [x] 16-01-PLAN.md - Update desktop center column structure for balanced proportions
- [x] 16-02-PLAN.md - Verify mobile/tablet layouts remain functional

### Phase 17: Theme Styling

**Goal:** Apply Modern theme colors, typography, and component styles

**Scope:**
- Update CSS variables / design tokens for Modern theme
- Apply beveled button styling to action buttons
- Update card component styling (borders, shadows, backgrounds)
- Ensure consistent hover/active states across all interactive elements

**Requirements:** THEME-01, THEME-02, THEME-03, THEME-04, THEME-05

**Estimated plans:** 3-4

---

### Phase 18: Component Updates

**Goal:** Update individual game components to match Mock versions

**Scope:**
- PartySidebar → MockPartySidebar styling
- ZoneView → MockWorldView styling and proportions
- ChatPanel → MockSocialSidebar styling
- Replace standard buttons with BeveledButton where appropriate

**Requirements:** COMP-01, COMP-02, COMP-03, COMP-04, COMP-05

**Estimated plans:** 4-5

---

### Phase 19: Cleanup & Polish

**Goal:** Remove experimental code and verify functionality

**Scope:**
- Remove MockGameScreen component
- Remove /theme-compare route
- Update Storybook stories for new theme
- End-to-end testing of all game features with new layout
- Fix any visual regressions

**Requirements:** POLISH-01, POLISH-02, POLISH-03

**Estimated plans:** 2-3

## Summary

| Phase | Name | Requirements | Est. Plans |
|-------|------|--------------|------------|
| 16 | Layout Migration | 4 | 2 |
| 17 | Theme Styling | 5 | 3-4 |
| 18 | Component Updates | 5 | 4-5 |
| 19 | Cleanup & Polish | 3 | 2-3 |
| **Total** | | **17** | **11-14** |

## Dependencies

- Phase 16 must complete before Phase 18 (components need new layout structure)
- Phase 17 can run in parallel with Phase 16 (styling is independent of structure)
- Phase 19 must be last (cleanup after everything works)

## Risk Mitigation

- **Layout breaks existing features**: Test incrementally, keep old layout accessible during transition
- **Style conflicts**: Use scoped CSS or component-level styling to avoid cascading issues
- **Responsive issues**: Test each phase at all three breakpoints before marking complete
